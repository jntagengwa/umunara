              In early 2007 a few individuals started holding prayer meetings
              over the phone through three-way conference call. As the number of
              those who were interested in joining prayers coming from all
              continents grew, on September 23, 2007 God led the group to
              register and to set up an account with FreeConferencePro. At
              Umunara, we welcome everybody regardless of their denomination;
              indeed whether you are a Christian or not please join us every
              Friday at 10:00 PM Eastern Time (USA & Canada) that is, 0300GMT at
              218-548-0820 and the pass code is 13579#.

            <p>
              As time went by, attendees to these conference services came to
              call this Ministry “UMUNARA” or literally “Watchtower,” a name
              that got incorporated with the State of Massachusetts on October
              02, 2008. Hence, as Prophet Habakkuk asserted in his second
              chapter verse 1 saying, “I will stand at my watch and station
              myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me
              and what answer I am to give to this complaint,” we have resolved
              to stand on our watch and to station ourselves on UMUNARA waiting
              to hear and to know the will of God. In other words, Umunara is a
              gathering of peoples from all nations who meet primarily on the
              phone conference call to wait for the Lord God. In the course of
              waiting, we worship, praise, and pray God and study the word of
              God.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Umunara, Inc we believe that the Bible, as it is inspired by
              God, is the only instrument that helps us to know the will of God
              and to know where to get our salvation: on the Cross Jesus Christ
              paid the price on our behalf, imparted on us His righteousness and
              our responsibility is to impart on him our sins and to receive Him
              as our personal Savior. Ku Munara duhura na Yesu: Abarushye
              n’abaremerewe bararuhuka, abarwayi barakira, Impumyi zirahumuka,
              ibipfamatwi birumva, ibimuga biragenda, kandi abakene baragezwaho
              ubutumwa bwiza (Yohana 11:5).

              A little over two years in existence, God, the Founder of Umunara,
              has enabled us to reach His people from all continents using His
              servants stationed in various parts of the world. In addition to
              conference calls held regularly, Umunara’s website enabled people
              who were unable to participate live to the conference to listen to
              the message preached every Friday. We thank Mr. Sylvain Ntwali who
              selflessly helped us to put together and to maintain this site.
              Furthermore, Umunara has been able to start a number of
              departments that help to answer some of the questions believers
              have. In the interest of strengthening families, youth, female and
              male departments were established. Once in a while, female and
              male departments meet together to offer valuable teachings needed
              for couples and couples to be.

              As prayer is the key to the success of Umunara, a Prayer
              department was established to coordinate the prayer chain 24/7 at
              Umunara; this helps us to have someone at the rampant all the time
              (ku izamu ry’Umunara). Mrs. Marie-Therese Gakumba lead this
              department. Fasting prayers are being organized throughout the
              month and some over night prayers have been and continue to be
              held thanks to your commitment. As at Umunara we are committed to
              the thorough learning and/or teaching of the Word of God, various
              seminars have been organized over the conference calls and experts
              have given topical teachings. We thank all who have participated
              into these programs and more participation in the future is
              requested!
            </p>

              At this particular juncture, it is safe to say that we are looking
              into the future with greate hope and anticipation. Recently,
              Freeconferencepro has experienced a massive increase in usage of
              their conference systems that caused our experiencing connectivity
              problems during our services. Fortunately, they upgraded their
              systems and have allocated us a new conference access number which
              is 218-548-0820; the pass cod remained the same. This upgrade
              temporarily corrected our capability issues but we still have a
              major challenge of purchasing our own conferencing system to
              permanently resolve these issues. We also thank God that Umunara,
              Inc. has a Radio now. All of these new projects will need
              financial resources to maintain them. If and when the Holy Spirit
              moves you to support them please make your check or money order to
              Umunara, Inc and send it at P.O Box 505194, Chelsea, MA 02150, USA
              and thank you.
