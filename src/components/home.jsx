                We are in the business of making disciples of Jesus Christ in
                all nations and to encourage them to obey His commandments. This
                is our Mission: to fulfill the Great Commission found in{" "}
                <strong>Matthew 28:16-30</strong>. We believe that the Bible, as
                it is inspired by God, is the only instrument that helps us to
                know the will of God and to know where to get our salvation: on
                the Cross Jesus Christ paid the price on our behalf, imparted on
                us His righteousness and our responsibility is to impart on him
                our sins and to receive Him as our personal Savior. Ku Munara
